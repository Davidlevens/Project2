<h2> How it works </h2>
Start at the register page to enter unique user information.

- ```Register button will take you to Present page with today's reminders``` 

- ```Choosing Add New Reminders lets you enter a reminder with date, time and email address```
  
- ```Reminders can be chosen by email address allowing for individual or group reminder notifications```
  
- ```We used the Notification interface of the Notifications API to configure and display desktop notifications to the user```

<h4>Below is a thorough, but not comprehensive, step-by-step process of how I got the app running in terms of code</h4>

- Navigate to root of project. Initialize package.json by running ```npm init -y```

- Creation of .gitignore file

- Creation of server.js

- Creation of .env file to store database information

- Creation of Models folder to define UserInfo.js and reminder.js 

- Creation of Routes folder to store API and HTML routes

- Creation of views folder to store all the different html views


- ```npm install dotenv```

- ```npm install express```

- ```npm install mysql```

- ```npm install mysql2```

- ```npm install moment```

- ```npm install require```

- ```npm install sequelize``` 

- ```npm install uglify-js``` 

>We ran into a few issues along the way that kept us from fully realizing all the functions of our app. We had a hard time with the the table associations, but eventually got it working with help from our teacher. 

>We still need to streamline the reminders according to each user, and the edit(update) feature is still being worked on.
